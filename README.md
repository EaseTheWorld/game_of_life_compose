# game_of_life_compose
Implement Conway's Game-of-Life with [Jetpack Compose Desktop]([url](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-desktop/))
- Each cell is a `State<Boolean>`
- Cells in root(0) geneneration are `mutableState`
- Cells in child(1 and later) genenerations are `derivedState` of prev gen
